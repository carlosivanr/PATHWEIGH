This directory was created to modify the original data processing pipeline.

The main change is located in how WPVs are identified. One reviewer commented
that the way indivdiuals enrolled in the control was different in comparison 
to the intervention period. This pipeline was used to remove the additional 
use of pathweigh tools as means of identifying index WPVs in the 
intervention. This resulted in a change of 20 individuals.
