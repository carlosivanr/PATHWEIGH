This directory was created to modify the original data processing pipeline.

The main change is located in how WPVs are identified. In response to reviewer
comments, that the way indivdiuals were enrolled was different in the control
period as opposed to the intervention period, this pipeline was used to remove
the additional use of pathweigh tools as means of identifying index WPVs in the
intervention. This resulted in a change of 20 individuals.
