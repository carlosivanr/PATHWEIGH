# Description: _________________________________________________________________
# This script is used to generate a series of datasets used for statistical
# analyses, generating tables, figures, safety officer table, and output for NIH
# research progress performance report (RPPR).

# This script calls several functions and sub scripts to process and produce
# deliverables All of these functions and scripts are located in a centralized
# emr_data_processing library at the following path:
# ("D:/PATHWEIGH/emr_data_processing").

# The purpose of establishing a centralized library containing the scripts is to
# facilitate re-usability across multiple COMPASS data deliveries. This modular
# approach was also adopted to allow reusing functions on separate subsets of
# the data that may be of interest

# Definitions: _________________________________________________________________
# Eligible - Defined as meeting Age (18+) and BMI (25+) criteria only

# Enrolled - Defined as meeting Eligible and at least one of several weight
# prioritized visit (WPV) criteria or visits where weight/obesity was the reason
# for scheduling the visit. Visits under which PATHWEIGH tools were utilized
# fall under WPV criteria as well.

# Weigh prioritized visit (WPV) - A weight prioritized visit is one in which the
#     1) chief complaint matches at least one of a vector of key-words related
#       to weight loss/obesity
#     2) ICD-10 code at the encounter matches 1 of the icd-10 codes of interest
#     3) Use of specific EPIC flow sheets including PW, OBHP, or WMQ
#     4) Use of Smart Tools in the EPIC EHR

# Index date - For Eligible and Enrolled (EE) patients
#     The index date is initially the first weight prioritized visit in each
#     phase of the study that an eligible patient has. There should be one
#     index date per patient in each phase of the study. One at control and
#     another at intervention. The first index date available per patient marks
#     the date of enrollment.

# Index date - For Eligible and Not Enrolled (ENE) patients
#     Many of the subscripts/functions employed rely on the index date. ENE
#     patients are not enrolled and thus do not have and Index date per se.
#     However, within each function/script ENE patients are assigned a pseudo
#     index date so that the function operates properly. These pseudo index
#     dates are primarily assigned to capture a patient's labs, screeners,
#     referrals, and comorbidities. For ENE patients, they're first assigned to
#     a Cohort where the majority of their visits occur. Contrasted with EE
#     patients where they are assigned to the cohort pertaining to the index
#     visit. The pseudo index or reference date is assigned to the first visit
#     in their assigned Cohort. Ties, if any, are broken by assigning the
#     index date to the date of the earliest encounter.

# Outputs: _____________________________________________________________________
# visits - a data frame of patient interactions within the UC health system
# clinics participating in PATHWEIGH within a specified date range. Includes
# encounters from EE and ENE patients.

# visits_post_id - contains visits where the EncounterDate is on or after
#   the index date and is includes visits from EE patients only. Requires an
#   index date visit to qualify for a WPV AND to meet the eligibility criteria.
#   This data set set does not restrict visits after the index date to meet
#   WPV criteria.

# mod_data - contains visits from EE patients that had 2 or more visits in each
#   phase.

# pp_data - contains visits from EE patients that had 2 or more visits in both
#   the control and intervention phases.

# Study periods: _______________________________________________________________
