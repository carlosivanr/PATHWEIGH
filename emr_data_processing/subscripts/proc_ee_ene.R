# Description:
# process ee and ene (eligible and enrolled and eligible not enrolled data)
# This script was created to process the ENE and EE data in the same way
# to obtain the same outcome variables for any potential comparisons
# 02/02/2024: Initial creating to consolidate data processing functions
# 08/09/2024: Major updates to store the created columns resulting from the
#             proc_ee_ene() function. To avoid having to re-process the data
#             when changes to data handling are made, the script now merges in
#             the necessary columns from the stored data.
# 09/11/2024: Additional updates to break apart the labs/procedures, eoss, and
#             comorbidities processing into separate steps for better trouble
#             shooting and for parallel processing. Modified the comorbidities
#             step to resemble labs/procedures and eoss.

# Capturing, labs/procedures, referrals, meds, eoss, and comorbidities is one of
# the most time consuming sections of the pathweigh data processing pipeline. In
# order to facilitate pipeline development, labs/procedures, meds, eoss, and
# comorbidities are processed once then stored. The purpose is to re-use the
# captured data if and when changes to the pipeline are made. Instead of
# capturing these data from scratch every single time, it should retrieve them.

# labs procedures, comorbidities, etc. if already processed.
