# Create safety officer table

# Description: This function will generate a gt_summary table in quarto format
# displaying the differences between intervention and control patients along a
# number of lab values, deaths, and hospitalizations

# Dependencies: This script was designed to work on the visits_post_id data 
# frame and the packages loaded in 02_process_rdata_image.R. This script also
# requires the safety_officer_table_layout.qmd file located in the 
# emr_data_processing/report_layouts folder.

# The rationale for requiring a separate .qmd file for this script is because 
# the SOT report requires a combination of text and tables which cannot be 
# accomplished in a regular R script.

  # Means that the safety officer table is only in the past year
  date_1 <- date_max - 365

  # if Rdata is after 10-17-22 then the necessary variables for this script
  # will be available, i.e. it will not work with deliveries prior to 10-17-22.

    # Create the safety officer table data frame -------------------------------

    # defined as the last visit in each phase per patient where weight was
    # captured regardless of WPV. In addition, data are filtered to look back
    # one year in the past.

    # The problem with the SOT is that the algorithm is set up to capture data
    # from the last visit in the previous year. At a certain point, all
    # encounters will be in the intervention phase because of the date window
    # to restrict data to the prior year. There will not be any control phase
    # visits to compare to intervention phase visits.

    # Possible solutions:
    # Create a different report layout template so that it doesn't break when
    # the tbl summary function does not detect any control phase visits.

    # the same.
