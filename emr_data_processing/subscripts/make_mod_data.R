# Make modeling data
# mod_data is the data frame for the modeling of the primary PATHWEIGH aim

# Inputs:
# input is ee_ene data set to be able to also compare ee vs ene in modeling

# Dependencies:
# requires visits_post_id data set as a dependency because it contains all of
# the labs, procedures, meds, and vitals captured at the index visit in each
# phase

  # visits in each of the control and intervention phases.
