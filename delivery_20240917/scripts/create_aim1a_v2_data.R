# Capture the visits from ee and ene patients after eligibility or enrollment
# criteria are met, dropping all visits without a recorded weight value.
# Filters for patients that have a subsequent weight value. However it
# does not consider wether there are subsequen weight values in each phase.

# Questions for data structuring
# Index visits must be on or before 03/16/2024?
#   - There are patients where the index date is after 03/16/2024
# Filter out visits without an NPI? Bc I thought it was ok if NPI not available
