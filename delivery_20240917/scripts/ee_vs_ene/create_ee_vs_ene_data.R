# Create interrupted time series data set for Mark

# Capture the visits from ee and ene patients after eligibility or enrollment
# criteria are met, dropping all visits without a recorded weight value.
# Filters for patients that have a subsequent weight value. However it
# does not consider wether there are subsequen weight values in each phase.

# Questions for data structuring
# Index visits must be on or before 03/16/2024?
#   - There are patients where the index date is after 03/16/2024
# Filter out visits without an NPI? Bc I thought it was ok if NPI not available

# Start with the visits data frame
# - visits will have an index date set for those that were ee and ene
# - visits also has an Eligible (18age/25bmi variable) and Enrolled (weight prioritized visit) variable
# - for both ee and ene visits, the index visit must have a provider npi
# - *** Will need to re-engineer the index visit
# - *** Re-engineer the Eligible and Enrolled variables

# %% Load functions -----------------------------------------------------------
# *** Will need to load the new set_index_date_ee_ene.R function
